# Chapter 1: Algorithms

`Algorithm`: set of instructions tailored to solve a problem

- receive **input** and give **output**
- example: take numbers in random order to sort them from least to greatest
- algorithm can only be correct if for each possible instance of a problem, algorithm outputs the correct solution to problem
- incorrect algorithms can be useful if their error rate is low enough

`Instance of Problem`: consists of input that satisfies constraints imposed in problem statement needed to compute solution to problem

Examples of Problems to be solved

- sorting human genomes
- traveling salesman problem
- cryptography and online secret keeping, secure transactions'
- resource allocation 

`Data Structure`: method of storing data in a computer in a way the meets constraints

`Parallelism`: splitting work amongst more than one processor cores and threads to speed up computation times


### Exercises 01

- 1
  - sorting the mail
  - finding the best way to package an item for shipping
- 2 
  - amounts of memory required, space. Reliability and error rate. Simplicity and ability for humans to understand it
- 3
  - dictionaries: it has insane look up times however if there are too many collisions then it could begin to slow down with the greater amount of times store inside
- 4
  - they are similar since both are trying to find the best 'path'
- 5
  - decrypting encrypted files
  - Finding the shortest path across all points in graph

## Algorithms as a Technology

Time and space are two things that are limited. Time that a computer takes to compute a thing and amount of memory and hard drive space in which to do it in

`Efficiency`: time and space required to compute solution compared against other algorithms

## Algorithms and other Technologies

- total system performance can heavily depend on algorithms used in the running of the system
- knowledge and understanding of algorithms is the thing that separates software engineers from script kiddies

### Exercises 02

- 1
  - computer graphics and ability to display same image regardless of hardware, display, CPU architecture and graphics card. Layers upon layers of abstraction
- 2
  - finds at which value n are both equations equal.
  - 8n^2 = 64nlogn
  - n = 8logn
  - n / log(n) = 8
- 3
  - same method as above
