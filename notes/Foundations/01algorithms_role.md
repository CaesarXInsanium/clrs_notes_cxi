# Chapter 1: Role of Algorithms in Computing

## 1.1 Algorithms

Algorithm
: Sequence of computational instructions tailored to solve a problem

- receive **input** and give **output**
  - example: take numbers in random order to sort them from least to greatest
- algorithm can only be correct if for each possible instance of a problem, algorithm
  outputs the correct solution to problem
- incorrect algorithms can be useful if their error rate is low enough

Instance of Problem
: Consists of input that satisfies constraints imposed in problem
  statement needed to compute solution to problem

Examples of problems that can be solved with algorithms

- sorting human genomes
- traveling salesman problem
- cryptography and online secret keeping, secure transactions'
- resource allocation

Data Structure
: Method of organizing data in a computer in a way the meets constraints and
needs for a particular application.

Parallelism
: Splitting work amongst more than one processor cores and threads
to speed up computation times

## Algorithms as a Technology

Time and space are two things that are limited. Time that a computer takes to
compute a thing and amount of memory and hard drive space in which to do it in

Efficiency:
Refers to time and space required to compute solution compared against other
algorithms.

## Algorithms and other Technologies

- total system performance can heavily depend on algorithms used in the running
  of the system
- knowledge and understanding of algorithms is the thing that separates software
  engineers from script kiddies
