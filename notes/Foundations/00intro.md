# Part One Foundations

This part will begin to focus on the design and implementation of algorithms. Here
is a description of all the chapters that will be encountered.

Chapter 1: Overview of Algorithms, what they are and how they are used. What the
importance of algorithms hold in the ability to solve problems.

Chapter 2: Defines an example algorithm, describes some ideas on how to
analyze algorithms and design of algorithms

Chapter 3: Defining mathematical notation and Equations, Defines asymptotic notation
standard notations and Big O

Chapter 4: Divide and Conquer and how to split problems into smaller chunks. Some
example algorithms that use these concepts and recursion.

Chapter 5: Probabilistic Analysis deals with algorithms that use randomly generated
values in order to solve problems.

I have finished reading the first 100 pages of Art of Computer Programming a while
back. I now know that I know nothing.
